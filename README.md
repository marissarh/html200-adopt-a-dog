## About this project

This project is a website for a dog adoption agency. Users can view and browse a list of dogs up for adoption. Each listed profile includes the dog's name, photo, cost to adopt and a brief description about the dog. Users can also find our Adoptadog Blog for training tips and other blog posts about dogs. Once user decides on a dog they'd like to adopt, the user can fill out and submit the checkout form.
